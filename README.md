- ClassKit
- Accessibility APIs
- Natural Language, Create ML, and Core ML
- Some animation API

Although Iâ€™m really short on time, I made sure code quality and readability are not bad, and mostly followed good practices in using Swift (partial ranges, collection slices, etc.). And to make Playground looks aesthetically appealing, markup language, CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible, literals, and other playground essentials are used.
