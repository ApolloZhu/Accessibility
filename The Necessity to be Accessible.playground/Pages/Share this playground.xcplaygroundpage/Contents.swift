 # Teaching Others about Accessibility
 
 I hope you have enjoyed this playground, and is eager to allow more people to
 learn about accessibility through this then go out to support people with needs.
 
 One way to do that is adopting ClassKit, so teachers can assign it to students,
 should we have modified this to fit into an app.
