 # Sentiment Analysis
 - Important: For the datasets are *too large*, in order to run this playground, please
 1. download training data from [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/)
 2. unzip it
 3. drag and drop the `testdata.manual.2009.06.14.csv` file to the `Resources` folder you see on the left
 - Experiment: Ready? Let's begin!

//: But we should inform Core ML the csv doesn't have a header,
//: so it will use default column names: X1, X2, ...

//: Column 6 contains the sentence classified, so we rename it make it more clear

//: Now we can load the data tables and create 2 tables from it,

//: ## Exporting MLModel
//: Now we've verified it, let's save the model with some metadata to describe it:
let metadata = MLModelMetadata(
//: - Note: Change author to **your name**. In my case, I'm Zhiyu Zhu, so:
    author: "Zhiyu Zhu",
    shortDescription: "A model trained to classify sentiment",
//: - Important: We should pay tribute to Sentiment140 as we used their dataset:
    license: "A. Go, R. Bhayani, and L. Huang, ‚ÄúTwitter Sentiment Classification Using Distant Supervision,‚Äù in CS224N Project Report, 2009.",
    version: "1.0"
)
//: Save the trained model as `Sentiment140.mlmodel`
let url = playgroundSharedDataDirectory.absoluteURL
    .appendingPathComponent("Sentiment140.mlmodel")
try sentimentClassifier.write(to: url, metadata: metadata)
//: Lastly, we'll compile it so we can use it in our Playground
let compiledModelURL = try MLModel.compileModel(at: url)
NSWorkspace.shared.open(compiledModelURL.deletingLastPathComponent())
//: We're all set. Have a nice day!
