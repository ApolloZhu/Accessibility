/*:
 Probably your app is accessible now, but we want
 
 # No good design, but Excellent Design
 
 Does it take a lot of effort now? Maybe, but again,
 it'll be a lot easier to navigate your app,
 and your design will be improved as you adopt these features.

 ## Aggregate
 
 - Group elements together
 - custom actions - name, target, selector
 - custom rotors (name + item searc block) for quick skim through
 - header elements
 
 ## Disect
 
 - accessibility elements, accessibilityframeincontainerspace -> graph
 - UIDrag/DropInteraction accessibility
   - logical place to drag/drop
   - UIAccessibilityDragging, descriptor, point, in view with name
 
 ## Fine Tune
 
 - Focus + Magic Tap
 - accessibilityActivate (alternative gestures instead of slide)
 - accessibilityIncrement, accessibilityDecrement (slider)
 - layoutchange notification
