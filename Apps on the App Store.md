Yes, I do not have any app on the App Store with this account, because I'm not 18 yet, but I'll be on April 17th. So all the apps I developed are on my legal guardian's account, or GitHub as I'm still polishing them.90

The app that's currently on the App Store is DMV A-Z. Here a-z is a commonly used phrase for "map," meaning this app will guide the user on the road to become a better driver. Surprisingly, that's the program that made me start to think about accessibility. Not all drivers have a perfect vision, for example, my dad. So while it is an app that prepares people for the exam with some practice questions, mainly for residents in Virginia, statistics has shown a lot of users are not my target audience.

So I initiated a process to make it more usable for others. I organized a group of friends at my school to help me translate the questions to other languages, such as Korean, Chinese, Spanish, and more, but there's just too much questions and it would take long to accomplish this. Meanwhile, I adopted more accessibility features into it, many of which I discussed in the playground submission, starting from support for Smart Invert, one feature introduced back in iOS 11 which I find very helpful at night (as I have reduced vision as well).

With suggestions from UI labs at WWDC, I have incorporated them to improve the app, such as a more unified layout and animations so users won't be surprised by the subtle changes. From there, I think even deeper, with care for those that can't distinguish colors easily. Originally both correct and wrong answers to a question are indicated by color alone, but in the new improved version, a strikethrough is added for wrong answers in addition to the red color to make it more clear to them that it is indeed, wrong.

Of course, there's still a lot I need to do to make it even more accessible. But step by step, I wish to spread the message, and introduce more people to the idea of accessibility, so more will dedicate to bring technology to everyone.
