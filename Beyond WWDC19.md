This year, I did something other than blog posts to advertise for WWDC scholarship. GGTalk, the podcast show by Swift GG (a famous translation team in China), invited me as a guest speaker. I shared my experience as a 2nd time WWDC Scholarship recipient, how I prepared for it, and what I learned by attending the conference with different strategies each year. The episode has <#number#> listeners at the time of writing, and many people have came to me for help and general guidance. I happily directed them to useful resources, and encourage them to not give up. Many of them didn't realize the 3 minute restriction, so I made announcements everywhere to remind other participants. Hope I'll be able to meet all of them at WWDC this year, serving as a "tour guide" to help them navigate the wonderful conference with even more discoveries.
