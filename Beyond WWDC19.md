This year, I did something more than just blog posts to advertise for WWDC Scholarship. GGTalk, the podcast show by Swift GG (a famous translation team in China), invited me as a guest speaker. I shared my experience as a 2nd time WWDC Scholarship recipient, how I prepared for it, and what I learned by attending the conference with different strategies each year. The episode has <#number#> listeners at the time of writing, and many people have came to me for help and general guidance. I happily directed them to useful resources, and encourage them to not give up. Many of them didn't realize the 3 minute restriction, so I made announcements everywhere to remind other participants. Hope I'll be able to meet all of them at WWDC this year, serving as a "tour guide" to help them navigate the wonderful conference with even more discoveries.

For sure I still convince students in my school to apply for this scholarship, but they shall be better prepared. During the hackathon I hosted leading the CS Club at Oakton High School last December, I provided one-to-one assistance to help teams build their first mobile app, and awarded the winner of "Best program written in Swift" with pins and stickers I got from WWDC last year. Later at HooHacks, I taught my all 3 teammates Swift, and together we built an ARKit app that displays a 3D map on the ground for easy exploration of neighborhoods, which the source code on GitHub.

I'm also contributing to and maintaining many other open source Swift projects to spread the usage of Swift. One of them is EFQRCode, a software library for generating artistic QRCode using CIImage. Not only did I update its sample app to be more accessible, I brought the QRCode generation capability to watchOS and all other platforms that support Swift. One of the unit test I used revealed an puzzling bug on Linux only, so I dived into it, realizing it's bug in Foundation in Swift 5, so I opened a pull request to fix the issue. I'm really glad that I helped to make Swift a better language and making it available for more developers.

To introduce more inquisitive people to swift, not only do I continue to translate CS193p (Developing iOS Apps with Swift) to Simplified Chinese so people with language difficulties can learn Swift as well, I adapted my Swift tutorials released on bilibili. Instead of producing long videos, I switched to writing short articles, a more familiar and easier to consume format in Chinese online communities. In my column named "为美好的 Swift 献上祝福," or "Blessing of Swift", I share useful but unheard-of tips and tricks about Swift that's helpful to all users. In the early days when the platform has no support for code highlighting, I manually colored each word as they would appear in Xcode to provide them a better learning experience.
